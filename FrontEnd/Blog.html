    <p style="font-weight: bolder;"> ...me? What are the chances?</p>
    <p>
        The chances of me finishing this project did not look great at the start: <br>
        - I was a full-time career transitioner who never attended any IT course <br>
        - Virtually 0 experience of the portal <br>
        - I did not know what a command line was until 2023! <br>
        ….and I was supposed to create a cloud-based resume? Yikes!
        <br>
        <br>
        To say that this project was easy would be me lying. But you are reading this...which means I am very stubborn
        (un)fortunately.</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bolder;"> Mindset shift required to stay resilient: Fail often, FaiL forward</p>


    <p>Have you ever heard about the 4 stages of competency? It a model that talks about the different stages of learning a new
    skill:    </p>

    <p> For me, each new stage was me jumping back and forth between the “unconscious incompetence” and “conscious
    incompetence”. In summary, I learned a whole lot about what I didn’t know. It was humbling shift in identity. During the
    day I was confident and even mentored new starters and during the evenings I became a beginner. Every step involved
    words and contexts I’ve never heard of. There was a lot of stopping, to understand and research and try. Then return to
    the challenge and stopping to troubleshoot. This happened multiple times, and sometimes in cycles. 
    My motto had to become "fail often, fait forward".. so much so that I celebrated having a different error, rather than the same one! </p>

    <p style="font-weight: bolder;"> My favourite mistakes</p>

    <p>
    1) I didn’t realise how important essential file placements and local folder structures were for deployment and CI/CI.
    I remember attempting to deploy Azure Functions multiple times using ARM. At first the function couldn’t be found. When
    that was solved, it did not recognise that the runtime was Python. After days of troubleshooting, I giggled out of
    desperation and tiredness and desperation when I realised that all I needed to do was to organise my folders and files
    better! However I clearly didn’t learn so I life thought me a lesson. When I connected it to GitHub- it basically said
    it couldn’t open the zip file it had automatically created from local repository. Again, desperation just to find out I
    had collected a bunch of unnecessary files which was confusing the workflow. Lesson learned for sure!
    <br>
    <br>
    2) I was humbled by the ARM template (lack of direction) but learned how co-dependent some Azure resources are. I guess
    I had failed to realise how many services are co-dependant on others. For example, I thought I would simply create the
    function app and that it would be a breeze! Soon realised I needed storage so I added it. And then realised I needed a
    service plan…and then storage and finally application insights! 
    <br>
    <br>
    3) (almost) bankrupt lead to the birth of the cost optimisation queen!
        The quickest tool I learned how to use was the cost management tab!
        This was the first time I had ventured into Azure and was worries about racking up a bill!
        At the start of my project I had initially chosen Azure front door to host my static website however the forecast cost
        wasn’t looking good. So I did my research and realised that
        Azure CND would be as good!
        Side note, I became so good at it that Azure advise doesn’t even have any more suggestions!
    <br>
    <br>
        I was relentlessly bullied by error logs however I am proud of my resilience and proud to say that I am at the
        “conscious competence stage”!
