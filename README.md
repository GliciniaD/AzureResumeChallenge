What is this project and why was it done?
What you see here is the Azure Resume challenge completed. Essentially, the aim was to:
1) create static website ( using Azure storage)
2) embed a visitor counter (using Azure Functions and cosmos database)
3) Set up CI/CD workflow (Github)
I wanted to complete this project as I'm an aspiring cloud engineer and wanted to gain pratical experience of: deploying and connecting services, troubleshooting and scripting.

I've also used HTML, CSS, Python and Javascript.
